    ">* **The Analysis of the Data:** I reviewed approximately 8,700 datapoint related to passnegers on the Spaceship Titanic. <br> \n",
    ">* **The Goal of the Project:** The goal of this project was to find a model that could predict if a passenger was transported to an alternative dimensions with an accuracy score over 0.79.<br>\n",
    ">* **Missing Data:** About 25% of the data was missing, however, I was able to impute some of this data using known data. For example, from Last Name of the passenger it was possible to impute some of the Home Planet and some of the Destination missing data.  <br>\n",
    ">* **Croygenic Sleep:** Passengers who were in Cryogenic Sleep during the trip were less likely to be transported.  <br>\n",
    ">* **Luxury Spending:** Passengers who spend money on luxury items like spa were more likely to be transported.  <br>\n",
    ">* **Models:** I utilized the following models: Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The boosting models gave the best performance. I used GridSearch CV with these three models. <br>\n",
    ">* **Extremet Gradient Boosting (XGB):** Best Cross Validation Score: 0.81. Best Test Score: 0.78. Modeling Time: 22 minutes   <br>\n",
    ">* **Light Gradient Boosting (LGBM):** Best Cross Validation Score: 0.81. Best Test Score: 0.79. Modeling Time: 2 minutes.  <br>\n",
    ">* **Categorical Boosting (CatBoost):** Best Cross Validation Score: 0.81. Best Test Score: 0.78. Modeling Time: 71 minutes.<br>\n",
    ">* **Final Model:** Best Cross Validation Score: 0.81. Best Test Score: 0.78. Modeling Time: 71 minutes.<br>"

    ">* **Domain Knowledge:** It is best if the data scientist has adequate domain knowledge on the topic of the analysis. I do not have any expertise in space travel or alternative dimensions. There may be parts of the data that I have overlooked that may have been important and I may have given importance to parts that may have had little significance. <br>\n",
    ">* **More Complete Data:** As mentioned earlier, there was missing data in every feature. Less missing data could have improved the performance of the models.<br>  \n",
    ">* **Pandas:** Continue to learn to utilize more optimized Pandas techniques and algorithms.<br>\n",
    ">* **Seaborn and Matplotlib:** Continue to improve my knowledge of Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating visualizations. <br>\n",
    ">* **Python Code:** Continue to write better and more efficient Python code. <br>\n",
    ">* **Clean Code:** Continue to adhere to the principles of writing clean code. <br>\n",
    ">* **Readability and Efficiency:** Continue to improve my skills to find the delicate balance between readability and efficiency in coding.<br>"
